# DevOnBike.Overfit.Analyzers

In-repo **Roslyn performance analyzers** for `Sources/Main` — the third guard layer next to
`BannedSymbols.txt` (named APIs, RS0030) and the MSBuild structural guards (jagged arrays,
one-type-per-file). Wired into `Main.csproj` as an analyzer reference (`OutputItemType="Analyzer"`,
nothing ships); tests and benchmarks are deliberately NOT covered.

## Rules

| Id | What it flags | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `OVERFIT001` | Heap array allocation (`new T[n]`, `new[]{…}`, `[…]` targeting an array) in **per-call** code — use `PooledBuffer<T>` / `PooledArray` (pooled scratch), `TensorStorage<T>` (tensor data) or `stackalloc` (small fixed-size) | ✅ shipped |
| `OVERFIT002` | Jagged array allocation (`new T[n][]` — N+1 heap objects, pointer-chase per row) in per-call code — flat `T[]` Span-sliced per row (`float[][]` is a build ERROR via the MSBuild guard regardless) | ✅ shipped |
| `OVERFIT003` | Boxing conversions (value type → `object`/interface) in per-call code | ✅ shipped |
| `OVERFIT004` | Closure/delegate allocation in per-call code: **capturing** lambdas (non-capturing are compiler-cached → silent) and **instance** method groups (static are cached since C# 11 → silent) — `OverfitParallel` takes function pointers for a reason | ✅ shipped |
| `OVERFIT005` | `foreach` over an interface-typed collection (heap enumerator + interface dispatch per element; arrays/`List<T>`/`Span` are fine) | ✅ shipped |
| `OVERFIT006` | String interpolation/concatenation in per-call code (exception path + `ToString` overrides + constant folds exempt) | ✅ shipped |
| `OVERFIT007` | Expanded-form `params` calls (hidden array per call; empty `params` → cached `Array.Empty`, silent) | ✅ shipped |
| `OVERFIT008` | Raw `Parallel.For/ForEach/Invoke` — ignores `SuppressParallelismOnCurrentThread` (oversubscription in data-parallel replicas, measured 1.8× slower) and allocates per dispatch (measured ~925 KB vs 0 B on the OverfitParallel pool). **Warning repo-wide in Main** (no per-call exemption — a suppress leak in a ctor breaks replicas the same way); measured exceptions keep `#pragma` + the benchmark cited | ✅ shipped |
| `OVERFIT009` | `.ToArray()` in per-call code (explicit hot-path ban in `Sources/Main/README.md`) — slice the existing buffer or use pooled memory | ✅ shipped |
| `OVERFIT015` | Direct `Xxx.IsSupported` on a hardware-intrinsics class outside `CpuFeatures` — gate ISA paths through `CpuFeatures.HasXxx` (one audit point, composed flags like `HasAvx2Fma`, identical JIT constant-folding; the two strays found at introduction were migrated). **Warning repo-wide in Main**, like 008 — it's a convention rule, not an allocation-context rule | ✅ shipped |
| `OVERFIT010` | Per-call `new List<T>` / `Dictionary` / `HashSet` / `Queue` / `Stack` / `StringBuilder` / `MemoryStream` — pool it (`docs/performance-patterns.md` #1 ObjectPool, #26 ValueStringBuilder, #46p RecyclableMemoryStream) | proposed |

## Extended catalog (grounded in `docs/performance-patterns.md`, 110 patterns)

**Tier A — precise, low-false-positive, implement next** (each cites the pattern doc):

| Id | Rule | Source pattern |
|---|---|---|
| `OVERFIT011` | Struct used as `Dictionary<K,V>`/`HashSet<K>` key without `IEquatable<K>` / record struct — the DEFAULT `Equals`/`GetHashCode` for structs is **reflection-based** | #46g |
| `OVERFIT012` | Finalizer declared (`~T()`) — finalizable objects allocate slower and survive ≥2 GC generations; `IDisposable` + `GC.SuppressFinalize` instead | #48a |
| `OVERFIT013` | `.Count` read on `ConcurrentQueue`/`ConcurrentBag` (segment-walking + sync) — use `IsEmpty` or an approximate `Interlocked` counter | #80 |
| `OVERFIT014` | `a.ToLower() == b.ToLower()` / `.ToUpper()` comparison — allocates two strings; use `string.Equals(a, b, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase)` | #46o |
| ~~`OVERFIT015`~~ | ~~IsSupported inside a loop~~ — **superseded & SHIPPED** as the broader rule: direct `Xxx.IsSupported` anywhere outside `CpuFeatures` → gate via `CpuFeatures.HasXxx` (one audit point; `static readonly bool` folds to a JIT constant exactly like the raw intrinsic, and hoisting falls out naturally) | #64, #67 |

**Tier B — heuristic, suggestion-only severity:**

| Id | Rule | Source pattern |
|---|---|---|
| `OVERFIT016` | Large struct (est. > 64 B = cache line) passed by value — pass by `in`/`ref` | #56 principle 1 |
| `OVERFIT017` | Struct declared without `readonly` though all fields could be — defensive copies | #2 |
| `OVERFIT018` | `readonly` field holding a MUTABLE struct (e.g. an enumerator) — every access is a defensive copy, mutation is silently lost | #90 (the "Do NOT make this readonly" trap) |
| `OVERFIT019` | Non-capturing lambda without the `static` keyword — `static` guards against future accidental captures | #46h |

**Tier C — architectural (need a convention/attribute):**

- **`[OverfitHotPath]` attribute** (Roslyn's `[PerformanceSensitive]`, #35): escalates ALL OVERFIT rules to **error** inside marked methods/types — the per-method evolution of the per-directory editorconfig ratchet.
- `foreach` over `List<T>` in hot paths → indexed `for` / `CollectionsMarshal.AsSpan` (#46c) — too noisy globally, only under `[OverfitHotPath]`.

**Handled via `BannedSymbols.txt` instead of analyzer rules** (named symbols → cheaper; added 2026-06-12):
`Buffer.BlockCopy` (measured slowest copy in `CopyAndPoolBenchmark` — both Main sites migrated to `Span.CopyTo`),
`string.Intern` (#48b — global-table lock contention; Roslyn ditched it for `StringTable`),
`System.Threading.ReaderWriterLock` (#48d — obsolete kernel-mode lock, use `ReaderWriterLockSlim`).

**Deliberately NOT rules** (not statically decidable / measured-context-dependent): SOA vs AoS (#55),
false-sharing padding (#57), `[SkipLocalsInit]` adoption (#22 — project-level decision), anti-DRY
hot-method size (#93), `ManualResetEventSlim` spinCount (#95).

## Noise policy (OVERFIT001)

**One-time allocations are exempt**: field/property initializers, instance constructors (layer
weights live as long as the object), static constructors, and compiler-generated (implicit)
creations such as `params` arrays. Flagged is exactly the per-call surface: method bodies,
accessors, lambdas, local functions. Justified sites: `#pragma warning disable OVERFIT001` + a
comment saying why.

## Severity ladder (configured in the root `.editorconfig`)

Three levels with distinct meanings — **suggestion** = known debt, visible in the IDE;
**warning** = fix before you finish the feature; **error** = never merges.

- **Everywhere**: `suggestion`
- **Hot directories** (`Kernels/`, `Intrinsics/`, `Ops/`): **warning**
- **Errors** (criteria: zero existing sites + unconditional rule + trivial fix/pragma + high miss-cost):
  - `OVERFIT008` + `OVERFIT015` — **error repo-wide in Main** (suppress leak silently breaks DP
    training; CpuFeatures gating is a hard convention — same class as RS0030)
  - `OVERFIT001`/`002`/`009` — **error in `Kernels/` + `Intrinsics/`** (per-call allocation in a pure
    kernel is never right; a justified exception is an explicit `#pragma` with the reason)
- Clean a directory → escalate it in `.editorconfig`. Never loosen.

## Triage executed 2026-06-12 — build is at **0 warnings**

The 45 findings at introduction were resolved deliberately, not swept:

- **Fixed (17)**: 13× OVERFIT008 migrated to `OverfitParallel.For` (Adam ×3 — its explicit
  `Options` arg dropped, the wrapper supplies it; DataParallelTrainer ×3; TrainableLlamaModel ×3;
  OfflineTrainingJob ×2; DataAugmenter; FastRandomForest — semantics equal or better: they now
  inline gracefully under suppression). 4× OVERFIT001 pooled: PoolingKernels ×2 (the `inputW > 128`
  branch next to the existing stackalloc → conditional `PooledBuffer`, `default` disposes as a
  no-op) and BatchNorm backward `sumDy`/`sumDyX` → `RentArray`/`ReturnArray` + try/finally (every
  slot is assigned before read, so no Clear needed).
- **Pragma'd with the reason cited (4)**: Evolutionary ×2 (caller-configurable `ParallelOptions` /
  `Partitioner`+`ForEach` — APIs `OverfitParallel` doesn't have; never runs inside DP replicas),
  `TensorMath.Sequence` LSTM backward (stateful `localInit`/`localFinally` overload; the suppress
  case has its own inline branch) and its tape-recording `AutogradNode[]` (owned by the graph until
  `Reset()` — pooling would change the `Record` contract).
- **Downgraded to suggestion with rationale in `.editorconfig` (24)**: the CTC family (15 — OCR/
  training path, not serving-hot; beam search needs a redesign, re-escalate if OCR productises) and
  OVERFIT004 in `Ops/` (8 — training graph-ops dispatch through closures BY DESIGN; Spans cannot
  cross a delegate boundary; the zero-alloc CONTRACT is the inference path, training is
  allocation-quiet at ~4.6 KB/batch per the MNIST audit).

**`LanguageModels/Runtime` SWEPT & ESCALATED 2026-06-12** — all 85 sites resolved (batched-prefill
scratch pooled: measured **748 MB → 0 B** allocated per 272-token prefill at steady state, greedy
output bit-identical; load-time/by-contract sites carry justified `#pragma`s) and the directory is
now a **warning** in the ratchet. Lesson encoded in the code comments: rented arrays are longer than
requested — pass **exact-length slices** to any callee that reads `span.Length` (the MoE router bug
the suite caught). Remaining suggestion-level backlog (repo-wide): OVERFIT001 ~340 sites — `Loading`
60, `Audio/Tts` 38, `Whisper` 33, `DeepLearning` 30, …

## Authoring notes

- Target `netstandard2.0` (analyzers run inside the compiler/IDE host); `Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp`
  pinned ≤ the SDK compiler version.
- Use the `IOperation` API (`OperationKind.ArrayCreation`, `CollectionExpression`) — it sees through
  syntax variants; skip `IsImplicit` operations.
- Each rule: `EnableConcurrentExecution`, `ConfigureGeneratedCodeAnalysis(None)`, category
  `Performance`, default severity Warning (the editorconfig ratchet scopes it down/up per path).
